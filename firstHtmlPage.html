		<h1>Jesus</h1>

<p><b>Jesus</b>[e] (c. 4 BC â€“ AD 30 / 33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or 
Jesus Christ,[f] was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader.[12] 
He is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. Most
 Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited 
 Messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.[13][14]</p>

<p>Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed 
historically,[g] although the quest for the historical Jesus has yielded 
some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how 
closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus, as 
the only records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels.[21][h][i] Jesus
 was a Galilean Jew,[12] who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his 
 own ministry. He preached orally[24] and was often referred to as "rabbi".[25] 
 Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings,
 taught in parables and gathered followers.[26][27] He was arrested and tried by 
 the Jewish authorities,[28] turned over to the Roman government, and crucified
 on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.[26] After his death, his 
 followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually
 became the early Church.[29]</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>

<p>A typical Jew in Jesus' time had only one name, sometimes followed by 
the phrase "son of [father's name]", or the individual's hometown.[43] Thus, 
in the New Testament, Jesus is commonly referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth"[l] (e.g., Mark 10:47).[44] Jesus' neighbors in Nazareth refer to him as "the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon" (Mark 6:3),[45] "the carpenter's son" (Matthew 13:55),[46] or "Joseph's son" (Luke 4:22).[47] In the Gospel of John, the disciple Philip refers to him as "Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth" (John 1:45).[48]
